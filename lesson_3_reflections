When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to share your code (make it open-source), work collaboratively with others, and create a remote back-up of your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on something that will become a new branch, 
or others might push changes that you are not ready to incorporate.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - when you want to make a copy of someone else's repository, still on GitHub, and make the connection between the two clear. This is essentially beginning a new project while
giving credit where it's due. The forked repo belongs to you, while the original 
still belongs to its creator.
Branch - when you're adding an experimental feature, drastically changing the program, 
or otherwise moving away from the standard program but don't wish
to disturb the original. The branches exist in the same repository, with the same ownership.
Clone - when you want a local repository that is copied from another source.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This way, you’ll be able to compare your own working copy to what is publicly available. This comparison allows you to choose when and how you will merge your own copy with the remote. You’ll also have greater knowledge about how your own work is progressing in comparison to the remote version, even if you aren’t currently online.
